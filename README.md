Introduction
Now that you’ve learned about HTML, CSS and responsive design, you are ready to code your first web page! :rocket:


Technical Requirements
Your web page must:

Have a minimum of 3 HTML pages
Have content and styles
Include separate HTML and CSS files
You can choose any topic you like (movies, shows, a portfolio, a series of books, etc.)
One of the pages must include an HTML form

Process
The process of creating a website is the following:

Decide on a topic. It could be anything you like: movies, comic books, places to go out, video games, board games, travels, your portfolio/CV… But, make sure you find it motivating enough because you will spend some hours working on it.
Check the learning unit called Wireframing and content planning. It will guide you through creating the user stories and drawing the wireframes of your website (both highly recommended practices). Remember to pay special attention to what each page will be dedicated to. How will the user navigate through the different pages? What content is going to be on each of the pages? Gather up the information, pictures and data before creating the wireframe.
Start coding the HTML
Once you finish all the content and structure, start adding styles with CSS.
For this project, you will be working on your own. However, you are not supposed to have learned everything by heart. You are encouraged to:

Check out past course materials
Google doubts
Ask your colleagues
Ask your instructors if you feel blocked

:bulb: As it happens, when you are learning something new, it can get overwhelming sometimes. Try to keep calm and remember, it should be a little hard because it is your first website. Every time you code, it will get easier! Remember: practice makes perfect.


When Googling solutions, you will stumble upon really advanced solutions and pieces of code you don’t necessarily understand because you are at the beginning of a coding learning process. Don’t ever copy code you find online: not only will it be considered plagiarism, but it will hinder your learning. It’s better to struggle a little and code a less elegant (but ultimately yours) solution. :wink:


Deliverables
A working webpage, built by you that runs in the browser. You can take some content out of the internet (for instance, if you were creating a web page about board games, you are not required to invent board game names or images), but any code not written by you will be considered plagiarism.
It would be nice to have the page deployed on GitHub pages, which is free and would allow you to show everyone. Follow this tutorial to do so.
